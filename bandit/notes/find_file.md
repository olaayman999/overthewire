```bash
find . -type f -size 1033c -readable ! -executable
```
This command does the following:

`find .`: starts the search from the current directory `.`

`-type f`: specifies that we only want to search for files (not directories)

`-size 1033c`: specifies that the files must be exactly 1033 bytes in size

    `-size +1033c` => file size > 1033 bytes
     `size -1033c` =>  file size < 1033 bytes
    

`-readable`: specifies that the files must be human-readable 

`! -executable`: specifies that the files must not be executable

This find command will output the names of all files in the current directory and its subdirectories that match the specified criteria. If no files match the criteria, the find command will produce no output.

 There are several other options that can be used in conjunction with the find command to specify different file characteristics:

`-writable`: Specifies that the files being searched for must be writable.

`-type`: Specifies the type of file to search for. Possible values are `f` for regular files, `d` for directories, `l` for symbolic links, and `b` for block devices.

`-user`: Specifies the owner of the files to search for. You can specify a username or a UID (user ID).

`-group`: Specifies the group ownership of the files to search for. You can specify a group name or a GID (group ID).

`-mtime`: Specifies the modification time of the files to search for. You can specify a time interval in days.

`-atime`: Specifies the access time of the files to search for. You can specify a time interval in days.

`-ctime`: Specifies the status change time of the files to search for. You can specify a time interval in days.

`-name`: Specifies the name of the files to search for. You can use wildcard patterns to match multiple files.
