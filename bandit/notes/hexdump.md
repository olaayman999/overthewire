hex dump is a hexadecimal view of computer data, from memory or computer file or storage device. 

Looking at a hex dump of data is usually done in the context of either debugging, reverse engineering or digital forensics

In a hex dump, each byte (8 bits) is represented as a two-digit hexadecimal number. Hex dumps are commonly organized into rows of 8 or 16 bytes, sometimes separated by whitespaces. Some hex dumps have the hexadecimal memory address at the beginning.

Some common names for this program function are hexdump, hd, od, xxd and simply dump or even D.

## standard I/O

In Linux and Unix-like operating systems, the standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) are two of the three standard streams that are associated with every process.

Standard input (**stdin**) is a stream that is used to receive input data into a process. By default, stdin is associated with the keyboard, so when a process expects input from the user, it reads from stdin.

Standard output (**stdout**) is a stream that is used to output data from a process. By default, stdout is associated with the terminal screen, so when a process produces output, it writes to stdout.

The third standard stream is standard error (**stderr**), which is used to output error messages from a process. By default, stderr is also associated with the terminal screen.

These standard streams allow for a consistent way of receiving input and producing output from a process, regardless of what type of device or program is providing the input or receiving the output. This makes it easy to pipe data between processes, as the standard streams provide a common interface that can be redirected as needed.

```bash
cat file.txt | grep pattern
```
In this example, the standard output of the `cat` command is connected to the standard input of the `grep` command, allowing the data to be passed from one process to another without any explicit file I/O operations.




## xxd command - make a hexdump or do the reverse.

```text
xxd  creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input.  It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form.
       Like uuencode(1) and uudecode(1) it allows the transmission of binary data in a `mail-safe' ASCII  representation,
       but  has the advantage of decoding to standard output. 
       Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.
 ```
 the syntax is 
 ```bash
 xxd -h[elp]
xxd [options] [infile [outfile]]
xxd -r[evert] [options] [infile [outfile]]
```
The `infile` and `outfile` parameters are the input file and output file, respectively.

For example, to create a hex dump of a binary file named `file.bin` and write the hex dump to a file named `file.hex`, you would run the following command:

```bash
xxd file.bin file.hex
```
This would cause `xxd` to read the contents of `file.bin` and create a hex dump of the binary data, which would then be written to the file `file.hex`.
