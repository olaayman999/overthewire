The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

i tried connecting to the ssh via the default port (22) but it didn't work

```bash
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220
```
